  <h3>Tidy Data - Spreadsheets</h3>
  <p>
    Spreadsheets are useful for data entry and data organization, and some subsetting and sorting of the data as well as getting an overview of the data. 
    To interact with spreadsheets, we can use LibreOffice, Microsoft Excel, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, or other programs.
    If you do not already have spreadsheet software installed, please find setup instructions in
    the <a href="https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-spreadsheets/setup.html">Tidy Data lesson</a>.
